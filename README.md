# 8-1-Final-Project
My design approach for this project was simple. Since I have taken the course before I knew that it was
going to be difficult so I tried to find objects that would be simple design but would still allow me to
learn and try to develop my skills with OpenGL. After finding things around my house, I first tried to
analyze all the textures so I would have a good idea of what I would need to start the project. Next was
lighting of the scene which took me some time doing research to figure out what would work best with
the lighting in my scene. The course curriculum did a great job helping to keep everything organize
making the plan for my scene easy to follow.

When developing software, I like to go to the basics with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) it
helps organize the information and plan. This course was very similar to the SDLC with the milestones
along the way. There is a difference between development and design though, however being organized
is very helpful especially for me when working on this project. This project was a struggle for me, but I
found that the more I stayed organized the easier it was for me. While designing my 3D scene I felt that
making sure I knew what textures I was going to use before trying to implement them. I also found it
very helpful to research the different lightings before applying them to the scene.

Working with graphics and design I believe provided me with multiple skills and knowledge that would
be very beneficial in my future of education. Graphic design uses a lot of different functions of
computing languages and it helped me understand languages more. We only used C++, but the concepts
do not change as much as the actual language. The use headers, classes, and source codes was very
helpful with learning programming concepts.
In regards to professional opportunities I believe that graphics and visualization will help me
exponentially because I want to get into a similar line of work with game development. Some games
even use OpenGL and since that is what I have been working with and studying for the past eight weeks
I think my skills and knowledge on the subject will help.
